# Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.

Relational Databases are a database management systems (DBMS) that organize records into tables (each column represents a property and each row represents a record in that table)

# Why do tables need a Primary Key?

Tables need primary keys to make each record unique (normalization)

# What is the name given to a table column that references the Primary Key on another table?

foreign key

# What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables?

a bridge table linking the primary keys of both tables that have the many-to-many relationship.
